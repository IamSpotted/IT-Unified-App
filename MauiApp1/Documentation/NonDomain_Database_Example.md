# Non-Domain Database Restriction Example

## Summary
Your RBAC system now provides intelligent fallback for non-domain environments:

**Domain Environment:**
- Users get roles based on AD group membership
- Database access based on role permissions
- Can connect to any database server if authorized

**Non-Domain Environment:**
- Users automatically get SystemAdmin role (full app access)
- Database connections restricted to localhost only
- Provides security while enabling development/testing

## Testing the New Behavior

### Test 1: Non-Domain Environment (Your Development Machine)
```csharp
// This will work on a non-domain machine
var result = await databaseService.TestConnectionAsync("localhost", "TestDB", true);
// Result: ‚úÖ Successfully connected to 'TestDB' on 'localhost'

var result2 = await databaseService.TestConnectionAsync("127.0.0.1", "TestDB", true);
// Result: ‚úÖ Successfully connected to 'TestDB' on '127.0.0.1'

var result3 = await databaseService.TestConnectionAsync("PROD-SQL-SERVER", "TestDB", true);
// Result: üö´ Non-domain environment: Only localhost database connections are allowed. Server 'PROD-SQL-SERVER' is blocked.
```

### Test 2: Domain Environment
```csharp
// Domain user with DatabaseAdmin role
var result = await databaseService.TestConnectionAsync("PROD-SQL-SERVER", "TestDB", true);
// Result: ‚úÖ Successfully connected to 'TestDB' on 'PROD-SQL-SERVER'

// Domain user with ReadOnly role
var result2 = await databaseService.TestConnectionAsync("PROD-SQL-SERVER", "TestDB", true);
// Result: üö´ Access denied: You don't have permission to connect to server 'PROD-SQL-SERVER'.
```

## Allowed Localhost Patterns

In non-domain environments, these server names will work:
- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`
- `::1` (IPv6 localhost)
- `(local)` (SQL Server local instance)
- `.` (Current machine)
- `YOUR-MACHINE-NAME` (actual computer name)
- `localhost:1433` (with port)
- `127.0.0.1:1433` (with port)

## Blocked in Non-Domain Environments

These will be blocked for security:
- `192.168.1.100` (LAN IP addresses)
- `SQL-SERVER-01` (Remote server names)
- `prod-database.company.com` (Remote hostnames)
- Any server that isn't clearly localhost

## Benefits

1. **Developer Friendly**: Full access on non-domain development machines
2. **Secure by Default**: No accidental production database connections from dev machines
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Full permission system when domain-joined
4. **Testing Capable**: Use localhost SQL Server instances for testing

## Usage in Your Code

```csharp
public class DatabaseAdminViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private readonly IDatabaseService _databaseService;
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authService;

    public async Task TestConnectionCommand()
    {
        // Check if connection is allowed before attempting
        bool canConnect = await _authService.CanConnectToDatabaseAsync(ServerName);
        
        if (!canConnect)
        {
            bool isNonDomain = await _authService.IsNonDomainEnvironmentAsync();
            if (isNonDomain)
            {
                StatusMessage = "üí° Tip: In non-domain environment, try 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'";
            }
            else
            {
                StatusMessage = "‚ùå You don't have permission to connect to this server";
            }
            return;
        }

        // Proceed with actual connection test
        var result = await _databaseService.TestConnectionAsync(ServerName, DatabaseName, UseWindowsAuth);
        StatusMessage = result.Message;
    }
}
```

This provides the perfect balance of security and usability!
